geocentrism rocks!

Final project for the "Computing Techniques for Physics" course in the Bachelor's Degree in Physics at the University of Turin.

The goal is to simulate the solar system in C++, implementing a graphical motor with openGL to visualize the orbits of the planets in 3 dimensions. Coincidentally we also verify the validity of the second and third Kepler's laws.
