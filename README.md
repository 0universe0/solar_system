# Solar System

## geocentrism rocks!

Final project for the "Computing Techniques for Physics" course in the Bachelor's Degree in Physics at the University of Turin.
The goal is to simulate the solar system in C++, implementing a graphical motor with openGL to visualize the orbits of the planets in 3 dimensions. Coincidentally we also verify the validity of the second and third Kepler's laws.

## Structure

The project is subdivided in directories:

* src: containing source files (.cpp)
* include: containig header files (.h, .cc)
    
Moreover Make will be used to guarantee the automation of the compiling process.
If the project becomes too complex to use Make, CMake will be used,
in order to automatize the Make file generation used to build the executables (.out).
